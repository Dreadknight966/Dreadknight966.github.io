                        <li><b>Abacus</b></li>
                    <p>It all starts with the ancient times using natural materials in order to create visual representations of numbers. And I believe it all starts with the Abacus developed around 3000 BCE, it is one of the earliest tools used to perform arithmetic. Using rows of beads that can slide back and forth with each row, each representing a value. This was used in ancient civilizations including Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, and China. It is the simplest for of visualizing larger and larger calculations.

                    <li><b>Tally Sticks</b></li>
                    <p>Found in 35,000BCE in early human cultures in Europe and Africa. These were very simple sticks or bones used to carving notches that were records or counts. These tally sticks are among the earliest methods of keeping record and counting.</p>

                        <li>Logarithms (1614)</li>
                        <p>He is best known for inventing logarithms which is a mathematical concept that simplifies multiplication and division via transformation of these numbers into addition and subtraction respectively. This concept has revolutionized mathematics, especially engineering and astronomy.</p>
                        <li>Napier's Bones (1617)</li>
                        <p>One of his most important inventions are what are called Napier's Bones. designed to simplify arithmetic for large numbers. Consisting of rods and squares with the multiplication, it is capable of doing multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction.</p>
                        <h3>Charles Babbage (1791-1871)</h3>
                        <p>was an English mathematician, inventor, and mechanical engineer, known for designing early mechanical engineer and laid the groundwork for modern computing.

                        <h3>Alan Turing (1936) </h3>
                        <p>He proposed a concept of the universal machine which is known as the Turing machine it provided the basis for modern computers.
                            This also developed the concept of algorithms and complexity in computations. And because of his Turing test for artificial intelligence, it had an impact on the research of AI. Its influence can be found in computer science as it is the standard for understanding the principle of computation.
                        </p>
                        <h3>ENIAC (1945)</h3> 
                        <p>stands for the "Electronic Numeric Integrator And Computer." Is the first electrnic general purpose computer. designed by John Presper Eckert and John Mauchly. It was a US government funded project due to world war 2 adn was used to calculate artillery firing tables.  </p>

It grew in popularity quickly as it was featured on popular electronic magazines at the time. It was the first commercially successful personal computer.</p>
                        <h3>Apple I and II (1976-1977)</h3>
                        <p>Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak developed the Apple I and later the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced personal computers. Apple I was hand-built by Steve Wozniak. And then Steve Jobs who had the idea to sell the computer. It had about 200 units produced. The Apple II was the first mass produced product manufactured by apple. It was the first home computer on the market becoming the most successful and recognizable computer of the generation because of its ease of use and features.</p>

As more and more machines become more powerful and now more accessible, as Personal computers are now common place in most homes. Many innovations seem to coming such as VR and AR technology with facebook meta's vr headset, and apples apple vision headset release, the future technology we see in sci-fi novels has become closer than we think. And the future of computing is being improved every second and we see it everywhere such as construction, architecture, engineering, and space exploration.</p>

            <p>Hi! My name is Alon Villanueva. I am a first year college student studying Computer Science at the University Perpetual Help Molino Campus. <br> I like to play online games such as shooter and mmo's. I have a passion for computers specifically coding in alot of different programming languages. <br> I believe in learning and discovering things takes time in order for it to become a real skill but eventually I will learn to become a great programmer.</p>
